Weather Status is a simple and beautiful desktop app for macOS. It shows the current weather situation on the status bar and provides a more detailed version of the weather conditions of your current location once clicked.

Weather Status also provides a 7-day weather forecast which can be viewed by scrolling left on the tiles. Upon hovering the cursor on the image of the forecast, it shows a popup with more information about the weather on that day.
