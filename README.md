Weather Status is a simple and beautiful desktop app for macOS. It shows the current weather situation on the status bar and provides a more detailed version of the weather conditions of your current location once clicked.

Weather Status also provides a 7-day weather forecast which can be viewed by scrolling left on the tiles. Upon hovering the cursor on the image of the forecast, it shows a popup with more information about the weather on that day.


I've chosen to open source only a part of this app but you can grab the complete and most up to date version of it on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-status/id1453284596?mt=12).

### Note:
The screenshot is from the App Store version 1.0.1. The current App Store version is 1.0.19. Much of the codebase has since changed and the version here doesn't accurately represent how the app currently works.
